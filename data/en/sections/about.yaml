# a summary about you
summary: 'Over the past 10+ years, I have built a reputation for turning complex people data into strategic insight—and for building the systems, teams, and tools that make those insights repeatable and scalable. I started my career in the classroom, moved into research then analytics, and most recently led the People Analytics function at TNTP. There, I built our enterprise data warehouse, launched a cross-functional KPI framework, designed org-wide survey strategies, and delivered executive-ready reporting that shaped real-time decisions.'
