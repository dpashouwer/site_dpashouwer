People Data Strategist | Analytics Leader | Systems Builder

## About Me

Over the past 10+ years, I've built a reputation for turning complex people data into strategic insight—and for building the systems, teams, and tools that make those insights repeatable and scalable.

I started my career in the classroom, moved into research then analytics, and most recently led the People Analytics function at TNTP. There, I built our enterprise data warehouse, launched a cross-functional KPI framework, designed org-wide survey strategies, and delivered executive-ready reporting that shaped real-time decisions. I didn't just grow with the role—I helped define it.

## What I Bring

- **Systems & Scale**: A proven track record of building and scaling analytics systems, teams, and strategy from scratch
- **Technical + Strategic**: Deep technical fluency (R, SQL, Snowflake, dbt) paired with sharp storytelling and executive influence
- **People Analytics Expertise**: Leadership in talent diagnostics, KPI design, survey strategy, and performance reporting
- **Team & Culture**: A track record of growing high-performing teams and strengthening culture through data
